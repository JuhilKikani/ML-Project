## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Student Performance Indicator** is a machine learning-based web application that predicts a student’s **Math score** based on various demographic, social, and academic factors. By inputting features such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and reading/writing scores, the model provides an estimated **Math score out of 100**.  

This project demonstrates a full **ML lifecycle**, including **data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment** on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## ✨ Features  
- 📝 **Input Form** – Enter student details (gender, parental education, lunch type, test prep status, scores).  
- 📊 **Prediction Engine** – Get predicted **Math score** instantly.  
- 🤖 **Multiple ML Models** – Uses advanced algorithms for high accuracy (RF, GB, DT, LR, XGB, CatBoost, AdaBoost).  
- 🔄 **End-to-End Pipeline** – Covers preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** – Deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for production-level scalability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

### Machine Learning & Backend  
- **Python 🐍** – Core programming language  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms & preprocessing  
- **CatBoost, XGBoost** – Gradient boosting models  
- **Flask** – Backend framework for web app  
- **Pickle (model.pkl)** – Model persistence  

### Frontend  
- **HTML5** – Web form structure  
- **Jinja2** – Template rendering  

### Deployment  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** – Hosting & deployment

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **User Input** – Student information entered via web form.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Features encoded and normalized for ML models.  
3. **Model Inference** – `model.pkl` predicts Math score using ensemble of ML models (RF, GB, DT, LR, XGB, CatBoost, AdaBoost).  
4. **Result Display** – Predicted Math score returned to user.
